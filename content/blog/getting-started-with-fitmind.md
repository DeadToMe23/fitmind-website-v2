# Getting Started with FitMind: Your Complete Guide

Welcome to FitMind! We're excited to have you on board. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to get started with your fitness journey.

## Setting Up Your Profile

The first step to success with FitMind is setting up your profile correctly. When you first open the app, you'll be asked a series of questions about your fitness goals, current activity level, and preferences.

### Key Information to Provide

- **Current Fitness Level**: Be honest about where you're starting. This helps our AI create appropriate workouts.
- **Goals**: Whether you want to lose weight, build muscle, or improve endurance, let us know!
- **Available Time**: How much time can you dedicate to workouts each day?
- **Equipment**: Do you have access to a gym, or are you working out at home?

## Your First Workout

Once your profile is set up, FitMind will generate your first personalized workout. Here's what to expect:

1. **Warm-up**: Always start with a proper warm-up to prevent injury
2. **Main Workout**: Your AI-generated routine tailored to your goals
3. **Cool-down**: Essential stretches and recovery exercises

## Tracking Your Progress

FitMind automatically tracks:
- Daily steps
- Calories burned
- Workout completion
- Weekly progress trends

Make sure to enable location services and health permissions for accurate tracking.

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Consistent**: Try to work out at the same time each day
2. **Listen to Your Body**: Rest when needed, but push yourself appropriately
3. **Track Everything**: The more data you provide, the better your workouts become
4. **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water throughout the day
5. **Get Enough Sleep**: Recovery is just as important as exercise
